This folder contains the code to generate the confusion matrices per label and averaged confusion matrices for each model in `confusion_matrices.ipynb`.

The Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated based on the predictions of the component models in `pearson_coefficient.ipynb`

An error analysis per dataset, task and evaluation setting is performed to get insight into the errors in `error_analysis.ipynb`. The meme ID, meme text and image caption were printed, but the output is not provided here due to privacy constraints that do not allow the datasets to be shared.

All the functions to work with these notebooks can be found in the `utils_error_analysis.py` script.
